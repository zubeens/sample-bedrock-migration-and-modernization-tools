Selector Validation for Agent Traces Evaluator

This module provides validation functions to detect mismatched selectors
in rubric configurations, specifically preventing run-level selectors
from being used in turn-scoped rubrics.

    Validate that turn-scoped rubrics don't use run-level selectors.
    
    When a rubric has scope='turn' and turn_selector_mode='narrow_to_turn',
    the evidence extraction context is narrowed to a single turn object.
    Using run-level selectors (like $.turns[*]) in this context will fail
    because the selector expects a run object but receives a turn object.
    
    This function detects common run-level selector patterns and raises
    a validation error if found in turn-scoped rubrics.
