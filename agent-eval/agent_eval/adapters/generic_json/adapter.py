"""
Generic JSON adapter implementation for trace normalization.

This module implements the core adapter logic for transforming Generic JSON
trace files or in-memory trace dicts into the normalized schema format. It uses a multi-stage pipeline:

Stage A - Normalize: Event discovery, field mapping, timestamp parsing, classification
Stage B - Segment: Turn segmentation for multi-turn conversations
Stage C - Derive: Derived field calculation (latency, tool linking, phases)
Stage D - Validate: Schema validation and adapter_stats generation

Note: Classification happens during normalization (Stage A), not as a separate stage.

The adapter uses config-driven field mapping from adapter_config.yaml and
implements graceful degradation with confidence scoring for missing data.

Public API:
    adapt(path, config_path=None) -> Dict[str, Any]
        Main entry point for trace normalization. Accepts a file path or in-memory
        trace dict and transforms it into the normalized schema format.

Constants:
    DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH: Path
        Default path to adapter_config.yaml, resolved relative to this module.
        This ensures the config loads correctly regardless of current working directory.
        
    ADAPTER_VERSION: str
        Version identifier for this adapter implementation (e.g., "1.0.0").
        Included in metadata.adapter_version field of normalized output.

Exception Taxonomy:
    InputError: Raised for file I/O issues or invalid input types
        - File not found
        - Invalid JSON syntax
        - Unreadable input files
        - Invalid input type (not file path or dict)
        
    ValidationError: Raised for schema/data validation issues
        - No events found in trace
        - Schema file cannot be loaded
        - Output fails schema validation
        
    AdaptationError: Raised for internal adapter logic errors
        - Unexpected errors during normalization
        - Configuration errors
        - Internal invariant violations

Example Usage:
    >>> from agent_eval.adapters.generic_json import adapt
    >>> 
    >>> # Basic usage with file path
    >>> result = adapt("trace.json")
    >>> print(f"Run ID: {result['run_id']}")
    >>> print(f"Turns: {len(result['turns'])}")
    >>> print(f"Confidence: {result['metadata']['run_confidence']:.2f}")
    >>> 
    >>> # With in-memory dict (for testing/programmatic use)
    >>> trace_dict = {"events": [...]}
    >>> result = adapt(trace_dict)
    >>> 
    >>> # With custom config
    >>> result = adapt("trace.json", config_path="custom_config.yaml")
    >>> 
    >>> # Access adapter stats for debugging
    >>> stats = result['adapter_stats']
    >>> print(f"Events processed: {stats['total_events_processed']}")
    >>> print(f"Penalties: {len(stats['confidence_penalties'])}")
